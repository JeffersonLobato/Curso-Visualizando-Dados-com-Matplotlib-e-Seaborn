<h1 style="text-align: center;">Study on Matplotlib and Seaborn</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Matplotlib and Seaborn are two very popular data visualization libraries in Python. Matplotlib is a fundamental and widely-used library in Python for creating plots and visualizations. It offers a wide variety of chart types such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, among others, and allows for detailed control of visual elements such as colors, fonts, titles, and legends.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
On the other hand, Seaborn is a library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to simplify and enhance the creation of complex statistical visualizations. It offers high-level functions for creating statistical plots such as distribution plots, scatter plots with regression fits, correlation matrix plots, among others. Additionally, Seaborn also has features to automatically adjust visual elements such as color palettes, fonts, and plot sizes, which allows users to create attractive and informative statistical visualizations with less effort.

Together, Matplotlib and Seaborn provide a powerful combination for creating high-quality data visualizations and helping to communicate valuable insights clearly and effectively.
